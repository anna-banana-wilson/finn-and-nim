# Finn and Nim (the website!)
I created this little website for a couple reasons. First, to practice my html and css skills. Second, as a way to share pictures of my adorable cats with others 
in a fun way. I intentionally made it look ridiculous, with a fluffy fur background for a reason. It's very entertaining. I promise, I can make a better UI when I'm 
being serious. 

I made it accessible to anyone via Heroku, so here's what it looks like: https://finn-and-nim.herokuapp.com/cuddles.html
